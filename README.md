# README #
A php framework to help programmers like me to create web applications easy and fast

*Ssx is compatible with PHP 5.4 or newer

Installation
------------

These steps below is like any php application but pay attention for details like startup folder"

1.  Copy all files on step back from your domain folder
	If your domain runs on **www/** or **http/** paste all files on the same folder not inside these folders. 

2.  To edit database data you'll need to execute **files/hash.php** on apache to generate encrypt database information
	This file does not work alone. Dont move this file to a new folder
	
3. 	Open your database and execute **files/base_ssx_mysql.sql**

4. 	Create one environment variable called **APPLICATION_ENV** with value **development**
	Set to **production** on final server
	
5.  Open **project/set/config_set.php** and replace encrypted informations generated by **files/hash.php**
	Remember to set these values relacted with **APPLICATION_ENV** value.

6.  In your apache/nginx and set your domain to run on **www/** folder

7. 	Execute your domain. You'll see this message: **Database updated. Refresh this page to continue** and your application is almost ready.

8.  Now you'll need to set access permission on admin. Access yourdomain/admin/
	user: administrator and password: 123456
	Change this password as soon as possible. Seriously.
	
Security Notes
--------------

In first instance your admin folder is opened to public access but you can change that.
Follow these steps for your own risk.

1.	Move **www/admin** folder to out from **www/** and rename to **www_admin/**

2. 	Move **project/admin** to out from **project/**

3. 	Edit **www_admin/index.php** to include **core/core.php** correctly

4. 	Edit constant values **www_admin/index.php** to reference project location correctly
```
	define( 'LOCALPATH',   realpath(dirname(__FILE__) . "/../admin") . '/' );
	define( 'LOCALLOWPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/' );
	define( 'PROJECTPATH',realpath(constant("LOCALPATH") . "../project")."/");
```

5.  In your apache/nginx and set your sub-domain admin area to run on **www_admin/** folder

6.	Copy **www/resouces/** to **www_admin/resources**
	

Additional Notes
----------------

A lot of programmers loves **composer** except me and because of that the Ssx framework does not have external dependences.
Like i said on the beginning this framework have a mission to help programmers to create easily and fastest web application.

Some messages is localized in portuguese. I'll change that soon.

All erros messages does not trigger any kind of Exception but you can find all errors in your errors_log.
The idea is change this in the future to improve debugs.
